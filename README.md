# Madison's Metagaming
  A content mod to add stuff that should already be in the base game. Will be updated sporadically as I find something I want. 

## Content
- Feats
  - [Fey Foundling](https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Fey%20Foundling). PF1e RAW says that this can only be taken at first level, but we use the honor system :)

## Installation
  Install via [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder), or manually via [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager).
  
  Has not been tested without Vek17's [Tabletop-Base](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Base) and other mods. It should theoretically work, but you may run into issues.

## Acknowledgements

  - All the moders who came before and contributed to this incredible community.
  - All the folks on the modding channels of the [Owlcat Discord](https://discord.com/invite/owlcat) for the help and sanity checking.
