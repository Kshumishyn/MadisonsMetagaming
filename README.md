# Madison's Metagaming
A content mod to add stuff that should already be in the base game. Will be updated sporadically as I find something I want. 

## Content


## Installation
  Install via [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder), or manually via [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager).
  
  Has not been tested without Vek17's [Tabletop-Base](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Base) and other mods. It should theoretically work, but you may run into issues.
